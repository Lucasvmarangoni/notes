# Notes 
A simple app for taking notes.

I created it using Claude.ai to record information and gather data during pentests or bug bounty. However, it can also be used in many other situations.

## Key Features:

- **Add Notes**: Create and manage notes easily and fast.
- **Drag and Drop**: Move and position notes freely, organizing them however you want.
- **Organize by Sections**: Divide notes into different sections for better organization.
- **Local Storage**: Save notes directly to your browser's local storage.
- **Export & Import**: Export notes as a JSON file and import them later when needed.
